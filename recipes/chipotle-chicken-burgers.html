    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These <strong>juicy, smoky and spicy chipotle chicken burgers</strong> are topped off with pepper Jack cheese, refreshing pico de gallo, and creamy chipotle mayo. Only use 1 or 2 chipotle peppers if you like things a little milder. Use fresh store-made pico de gallo to save time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 up mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices pepper Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepared pico de gallo</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon adobo sauce, lime juice, and the 1/8 teaspoon salt together in a small bowl; set aside. In a medium bowl, combine ground chicken, chipotle peppers, queso fresco, salt, and ground coriander. Form into 4 patties and place on squares of parchment paper. Refrigerate for 10 minutes to help patties firm up.</li>
        <li>Preheat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Brush skillet with butter and toast buns, cut side down, until lightly browned, about 1 to 2 minutes; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Fry burgers until chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 3 minutes per side. Turn heat off. Place cheese slices over patties and cover with a lid, letting the residual heat melt the cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread chipotle mayo on bottom buns and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cilantro. Add chicken patty and top with pico de gallo.</li>
    </ol>
